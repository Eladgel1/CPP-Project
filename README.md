**C++ Project**

A first year project presenting a zoo management program.
The system presents the user a menu where he can perform a several actions such as adding/deleting an animal from the zoo,
printing/changing an element of a particular animal according to its index, etc...

Each animal has its own unique characteristics, features and actions according to its type, which is structured according to the hierarchy shown in the code.
The system uses object-oriented programming in such a way that there is a database of all the animals and the user chooses which type of animal he wants to include in the zoo.
